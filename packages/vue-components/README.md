[![Lifecycle:Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Experimental-339999)](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/lifecycle-badges.md)

This package contains a library of Vue 3 components built using Vue 3 Composition API to implement the BC Design System.

Questions? Please email the <a href="mailto:DesignSystem@gov.bc.ca">GDX OSS Design Team</a>.

See repository: https://github.com/bcgov/design-system

To use, install this package and import the components into your Vue 3 application.

## Install

`npm install @bcgov/design-system-vue-components`

### BC Sans font dependency

This package installs [@bcgov/bc-sans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/bc-sans) as a peer dependency. You must import the font-face declarations from @bcgov/bc-sans and ensure the font is reachable for your end user. The Vue components require that the `BC Sans` font-face is available to display correctly. The components do not ship their own copies of the font to minimize your bundle size.

**Important!** If you are on a BC Government-provisioned laptop, you already have the BC Sans font installed on your machine. This package uses `BC Sans` (with a space) for its font styles. If you are using this component library but not supplying the font, it's possible that your machine will still display the font correctly for you, **but not your end user**. Make sure to check this by disabling the font on your machine or by testing with another machine.

## Use

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Header
      title="My application"
      :skip-links="skipLinks"
    >
      <Button variant="primary" size="small" @click="login">Log in</Button>
    </Header>
    <main id="main-content">
      <h1>Vue Components</h1>
      <Button @click="handleClick">Primary Button</Button>
      <Button variant="secondary" @click="handleClick">Secondary Button</Button>
    </main>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'
// If you're already importing the BC Sans font-face somewhere else in your
// project, there is no need to import it again. Just make sure the `BC Sans`
// declaration and font files are available.
import "@bcgov/bc-sans/css/BC_Sans.css";

// Import the individual components you need
import { Button, Header } from "@bcgov/design-system-vue-components";

const skipLinks = ref([
  { href: "#main-content", text: "Skip to main content" }
])

const login = () => {
  console.log('Login clicked')
}

const handleClick = () => {
  console.log('Button clicked')
}
</script>
```
